In the <head> section of the HTML document, add a <title> to give the page a title.

In the <body> of the HTML document, add a <header> section to create a navigation bar.

Inside the <header> section, add a <nav> element that contains an unordered list of links to different categories. Each list item should contain an anchor tag (<a>) with a unique href attribute that corresponds to the id of the corresponding category section.

Create a <main> section to hold the content of the website. Inside it, create a <section> element for each category, with a unique id that corresponds to the href attribute of the corresponding link in the navigation bar.

Inside each <section> element, add a <h1> element with the name of the category, and a <p> element to hold the content for that category.

As an optional step you may consider adding some css, javascript and javascript frameworks to make it look better, more interactive and dynamic.

Make sure to replace the "Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3" and the corresponding ids, links, and content with the categories you want to create.

In the <head> section of the HTML document, add a <title> to give the page a title.

In the <body> of the HTML document, add a <header> section to create a navigation bar.
Inside the <header> section, add a <nav> element that contains an unordered list of links to different sections of the website, including "Premium Articles."

Create a <div> element with the id of "user-status" to show whether the user is logged in or not. Inside it, add a <p> element with the text "Welcome, Guest" and two buttons, "Login" and "Register"

Create a <main> section to hold the content of the website. Inside it, create a <section> element with the id of "premium-articles" to hold the content of the premium articles.

Create a <div> element with the id of "login-modal" and give it a default style of "display: none;" to hide it when the page loads. Inside it, create a <form> element with a <label> and an <input> element for the username and password, and a button to submit the form.

Create a <div> element with the id of "register-modal" and give it a default style of "display: none;" to hide it when the page loads. Inside it, create a <form> element with <label> and <input> element for the username, email, password, and a button to submit the form.

Add a JavaScript script to handle the login and register modals display. Using the DOM API get the element by ID "login-btn" and "register-btn" and add event listeners to them. Use the onClick event to listen and toggle the visibility of the "login-modal" and "register-modal" element by changing the display css property of the element.

Add a JavaScript script to handle the user authentication using the submit event on the form elements of both "login-form" and "register-form".

Inside both event handlers, you prevent the default behaviour of form submition and use your code logic to handle the user credentials validation and/or registration.

On success, update the user status by showing the premium content and also change the "user-status" div content.
